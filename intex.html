        <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
        <p>Chemical industry is a vast industry that incorporates all different types of product producing industries
            whose generation is based on heavy use of chemicals. Usually, industries that are involved with industrial
            chemical generation are broadly known as chemical industry. As per the end-products, processes or raw
            materials associated with chemical industries, such industry can be classified into several classes.
            Understanding the huge diversity of chemical producing industries, such chemical industries are usually
            categorized under broad categories such as inorganic and organic chemical producing industries, fertilizer
            industries, refining and petroleum industries, electroplating and heat treatment industries, pesticide
            industries, hydro generated oil/soap industries, and so on (Soni, 2020). Along with these, sometimes
            pharmaceutical industries, agricultural product processing industries, chemical processing/supplying
            industries, etc. are also regarded as specialized chemical industries. Thus, chemical industry covers a
            variety of industries which are focused on producing chemicals of different purposes. Understanding these
            varieties of classes under chemical industry is important, since such clustering helps to design suitable
            policies, initiatives, and interventions more readily (Banerjee et al., 2003). The variety and extent of
            such chemical industries are more diverse especially in the developed countries where there are adequate
            opportunities for industrial growth (Arora et al., 2001). The developing countries are not much focused on
            the growth of their chemical industries since they are already struggle to meet the basic demands of their
            citizen and to maintain a sustainable economic condition.

            All these different types of industrial inclusions make chemical industry a vast industry incorporating
            investment and supply chain management of multiple different types of industries. This is why investment and
            compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the chemical industries are often higher than many other industries.
            The commonly considered subcategories of chemical industry is expected to reach to a worth of 953.9 billion
            of USD by 2027 at a 5% CAGR from the 873.38 billion of USD worth market of 2019 (Allied Market Research,
            2020; BCC Research, 2020). Though, the growth percentage might not seem that high, its corresponding
            monetary value of growth is extremely high and can regulate the growth of the country's economy
            tremendously. Even in 2016 and 2017, the CAGR of the chemical industry's total performance shareholder
            returns (TSR) experienced over 24% CAGR (McKinsey). This percentage of CAGR is significantly high
            considering the wide extent of multiple sectors of chemical industries. Unfortunately, many of such chemical
            industries are not much focused on their environmental sustainability; instead they are more focused on
            profit making. In this regard, Domazlicky & Weber (2004) argue that economic growth without enough
            initiatives of environmental protection wonâ€™t be sustainable and such unsustainability will lead to
            comparatively higher expenditure in the long run.

            Being one of the largest cluster of different types of product producing industries, chemical industries
            cause generation of different types of waste, most of which are highly hazardous chemical wastes and such
            wastes are responsible for causing environmental unsustainability. It is because most of such chemical
            wastes are not biodegradable and contain highly toxic chemicals. Besides, since such chemical industry
            produced wastes are generated under certain extreme physical or chemical conditions (i.e., high pressure,
            high temperature, concentrated acidic, or alkaline conditions, etc.), handling such waste sustainably is a
            huge concern. Improper handling and maintenance of these highly toxic wastes may bring about degradation of
            health or environmental conditions. Additionally, proper management or treatment of chemical wastes is also
            quite expensive, as such management initiatives often require sophisticated technological and technical
            set-up. Considering corresponding economic, technical, and hazard-related concerns of chemical industry
            produced waste, pregeneration waste minimization, known as source-level waste minimization, can be preferred
            over postgeneration treatment or management initiatives for chemical industry produced waste (Chaaban,
            2001). Thus, source reduction and waste minimization approaches can be considered as source level chemical
            waste minimization initiatives.

            This chapter explores and categorizes some of the major classes of waste produced in different chemical
            industries. At the same time, it discusses on some of the major source-level waste minimization initiatives
            that can be adopted by the chemical industries.</p>
