    <h1>industry about</h1>
    <p>The chemical industry produces many intermediate compounds that are used as the basis for many chemical products.
        The chemical industry produces more than 50 000 chemicals and formulations. For example, ethylene, one of the
        most important bulk chemicals from an energy point of view, is used to produce products varying from solvents to
        plastics. Also, many processes in the chemical industry produce different coproducts. Chemical industries
        consume fuels and electricity as energy and feedstock. This makes energy analysis of the chemical industry more
        complicated compared than that of other industries.

        A small number of bulk chemicals are responsible for the largest part of the energy consumption in the chemical
        industry. These are the so-called basic chemicals that are used as building blocks for many chemicals down the
        production chain. The most important basic chemicals are the family of petrochemicals (ethylene, propylene,
        butadiene, and benzene) from the organic chemical industry as well as ammonia and chlorine/caustic soda from the
        inorganic chemical industry.

        Ethylene and its derivatives are feedstocks for many plastics and resins as well as for fibers and detergents.
        Global ethylene production is estimated at more than 80 Million tons and growing. The United States is the
        world's largest ethylene producer, accounting for less than 30% of the world capacity. Since 1974, ethylene
        production has grown by 3% annually, while propylene has grown by more than 4% annually. Propylene has grown
        more rapidly – 5% per year – during the past decade or so. Ethylene and other coproducts are produced through
        cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In the presence of steam, hydrocarbons are cracked into a mixture of shorter
        unsaturated compounds. In the cracking process, hydrocarbon feedstocks are preheated to 650 °C (using fuel gas
        and waste heat), mixed with steam, and cracked at a temperature of approximately 850 °C. A series of separation
        steps produce fractions consisting of ethylene, propylene, a C4 fraction (e.g., butadiene), and pyrolysis
        gasoline (containing benzene, toluene, and xylenes). The gas mixture is rapidly cooled to 400 °C (or quenched)
        to stop the reaction, during which process high-pressure steam is produced. Injection of water further decreases
        the temperature to approximately 40–50 °C, and a condensate that is rich in aromatics is formed. The liquid
        fraction is extracted, while the gaseous fraction is fed to a series of low-temperature, high-pressure
        distillation columns. Feedstocks used are ethane, LPG, naphtha, gas oils (GOs), and (sometimes) coal-derived
        feedstocks. Many of the installations used today can handle different (if not all) types of feedstock.

        The single most energy-consuming step in the petrochemical industry is the steam cracking of hydrocarbon
        feedstocks into a mixture of shorter unsaturated compounds. Recent estimates of global energy consumption for
        the production of ethylene and coproducts are not available. Global (final) energy use is estimated at
        approximately 3 EJ. Energy consumption for ethylene production can be separated in feedstock and energy use.
        Feedstock energy use is generally equivalent to the heating value of the product, that is, approximately 42 GJ
        tonne− 1 (lower heating value [LHV]). Specific energy consumption for the energy use of the process varies
        depending on the feedstock, technology, age of plant, capacity, and operating conditions. In general, it varies
        between 14 (ethane feedstock) and 30 GJ tonne− 1 of ethylene (gas oil feedstock), whereas older plants can use
        more energy.

        The production of ammonia, a key component in the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizers, is a highly
        energy-intensive process. Roughly 80% of ammonia production is used as fertilizer feedstock. Ammonia is produced
        through the high-pressure synthesis of gases. Ammonia production in 2011 was estimated at 164 Million tonnes.
        Growth is found mainly in developing countries, where the production expansion is also concentrated.

        Ammonia is produced by the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen, the so-called Haber–Bosch process. The main
        hydrogen production processes used in the United States are steam reforming of natural gas and partial oxidation
        of oil residues. Hydrogen is produced by reforming the hydrocarbon feedstock and producing synthesis gas
        containing a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The carbon monoxide is then reacted with steam in the
        water–gas–shift reaction to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is removed from the main gas
        stream. The carbon dioxide is recovered for urea production or exported as a coproduct or vented. The hydrogen
        then reacts with nitrogen in the final synthesis loop to form ammonia. The ammonia is often processed to
        different fertilizers, including urea and ammonium nitrate, whereas ammonia is also used as an input to make
        other chemicals.

        Energy intensity of ammonia making depends on the feedstock used and the age of the process. Natural gas is the
        preferred feedstock and is used for more than 80% of global ammonia production. Coal is still used in countries
        with limited natural gas supplies (e.g., China). The use of natural gas provides not only higher production
        efficiency but also lower capital costs. The global ammonia industry is estimated to consume about 6.5 EJ in
        (final) energy. Part of the energy input is used as feedstock; that is, the hydrogen in natural gas ends up in
        the ammonia. This is generally equivalent to the thermodynamic minimum energy consumption for Haber–Bosch
        synthesis, corrected for losses. Hence, feedstock use is estimated at 19–21 GJ tonne− 1 of NH3 (LHV). Energy use
        varies between 9 and 18 GJ tonne− 1. The most efficient plants in the world consume approximately 28 GJ tonne− 1
        of NH3 (natural gas, feedstock and energy use). If all ammonia plants in the world would meet this performance
        (or a comparable practice for coal-based plants), this could result in savings of 22%.

        Chlorine production capacity is estimated at 63 Million tons at nearly 700 sites. Most of the chlorine is
        produced in Asia. The production of chlorine gas is an energy-intensive chemical process. In the process, a
        brine solution is converted into two coproducts, chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), through
        electrolysis. The three main electrolysis cell types that are used to separate and produce the chlorine gas and
        caustic soda are the mercury flow, diaphragm, and ion-selective membrane. In the diaphragm and membrane cells,
        the caustic soda requires an additional step of concentrating the solution so that it can meet market
        specifications for most products. Chlorine production is a main electricity-consuming process in the chemical
        industry, as is oxygen and nitrogen production. Energy use for chlorine production depends strongly on the cell
        type used for the electrolysis. Typically, power consumption varies between 2800 (membrane process) and 4300 kWh
        tonne− 1 (mercury process). In addition, steam may be used to concentrate the caustic soda in the membrane
        process. Membrane cells require the least amount of energy to operate. The membrane process is considered the
        state-of-the-art process. Countries in Asia and Europe have a higher share of membrane processes than do the
        United States and Canada.</p>
